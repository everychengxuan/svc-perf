IBM Storwize V7000 (and IBM SVC) is a powerfull virtualized storage system. It provides clients with unified access to various backend storage systems playing central role in datacenter storage management. So detailed IBM SVC / Storwize V7000 performance monitoring is very important for storage admins. There are several options for this task:
native SVC / Storwize V7000 GUI provides overall cluster performance graphs for last 5 minutes but no historical data and no volume/mdisk details
IBM's recommended storage monitoring solution - Tivoli Storage Productivity Center (TPC) is powerfull but too complex, slow and has ugly Java GUI
raw performance data is provided as "iostat" xml files that may be collected with cli commands and analyzed manually
Yoshimichi Kosuge has developed svcmon tool performing automatic iostat collection to database keeping historical data and providing simple graphs and reports
SVC / Storwize has embedded CIM provider supporting SNIA "Storage Virtualizer Block Server Performance" profile
Surprisely none of this tools provides complete solution with balanced feature set: easy to use, detailed per-volume graphs with historical data and integration with centralized monitoring systems.

So I've developed svc-perf - a script set for monitoring IBM SVC / Storwize V7000 performance with Zabbix. Performance data is collected from CIM provider in 3 minute intervals and is sent to Zabbix with zabbix_sender. Features include:
detailed per-volume, per-mdisk performance metrics: IOPS, MB/s, IO latency, read/write percent, average IO size
historical data is stored in Zabbix database
per-volume, per-mdisk graphs
volume and mdisk autodiscovery based on Zabbix low-level discovery. New storage system objects appear in a monitoring system in 3-5 minutes and deleted objects is retained for configurable period.
